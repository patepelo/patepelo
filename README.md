## Hello, hola, hallo. 👋

With a background in **Mechanical Engineering**, I'm now building a career in **Data Science** as a **Python developer**.  

I'm an Open-Source enthusiast.

I love maps and especially the **OpenStreetMap community**.

Last summer, I completed a full-time **Data Science & AI bootcamp** at **Le Wagon**—an incredible experience that I highly recommend!  

### 🌿 When I'm not coding...  

You'll find me hiking 🥾, mountain biking 🚵‍♂, or sailing ⛵ out at sea 🌊. Nature is my reset button.

Let’s collaborate 🪴
